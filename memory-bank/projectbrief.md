# Project Brief: Depths of the Bastard God

## Core Vision
A massive procedurally generated roguelike action-RPG inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's work with Lovecraftian themes. Built in Godot 4.4, featuring real-time combat similar to Dead Cells but with complete procedural generation for art, sound, textures, and creatures. **A 50-70 hour psychological spiral of despair across three distinct acts.**

## Primary Goals
1. **Epic Atmospheric Horror**: Create a deeply unsettling 50+ hour experience through cosmic horror themes
2. **Procedural Everything**: Generate textures, sounds, music, and creatures procedurally
3. **Massive Replayability**: Ensure each 50+ hour run feels unique through comprehensive randomization
4. **Deep Narrative**: Tell story through environmental details, emergent gameplay, and multiple endings
5. **Technical Innovation**: Push boundaries of procedural generation and sanity-based UI corruption
6. **Psychological Immersion**: Reality-bending mechanics that question player perception

## Core Requirements

### Game Structure - The Three Acts of Madness
**üïØÔ∏è Total Runtime Target: 50+ Hours on Half-Assed Playthrough**
- **ACT I: The Descending City** (~15 hours) - Semi-open city zones with twisted exploration
- **ACT II: The Drowning Depths** (~20 hours) - Dungeon-crawl with water hazards & sentient environments  
- **ACT III: The Dream Realm** (~15 hours) - Broken logic: maps loop, time skips, items lie
- **Speedrun minimum**: 30 hours even when played "dead inside"
- **Full completion**: 70+ hours with lore-hunting and all endings

### Revolutionary Sanity System
**üß† Reality-Bending Mechanics:**
- **High Sanity**: Stable UI, real item descriptions, clean combat
- **Medium Sanity**: Whispers, visual distortion, ghost enemies appear
- **Low Sanity**: UI lies, enemies disguise as NPCs, quests produce false outcomes, item text randomizes
- **Zero Sanity**: Only auto-saves (and they lie), game pretends to rollback/delete progress, retconned events, fake cutscenes, HUD malfunctions

### Advanced Save System Corruption
**üíæ Sanity-Based Save Manipulation:**
- **High Sanity**: Manual + Auto saves (stable, normal)
- **Medium Sanity**: Manual saves at shrines only (may fake saving)
- **Low Sanity**: Auto-only saves that rollback or fast-forward
- **Zero Sanity**: Corrupted saves with UI lies, false reloads, hallucinated cutscenes

### Key Systems
- **Advanced Sanity System**: Affects UI, saves, reality perception, and game mechanics
- **Blood Echoes Economy**: Currency system with Black Market (trade sanity for eldritch items)
- **Complex Mutation System**: Up to 3 per run, permanent visual/mechanical changes affecting story routes
- **Companion Survival System**: Rescuable NPCs affecting ending conditions
- **Multiple Endings System**: Transcendence, Corruption, Sacrifice based on sanity/choices/lore completion
- **Dynamic World**: Three distinct realms with unique mechanics and physics

### Technical Pillars
- **Procedural Generation**: All assets generated at runtime across three distinct realms
- **Dynamic UI Corruption**: Interface lies and malfunctions based on sanity
- **Save System Manipulation**: False saves, rollbacks, and corrupted data as gameplay mechanics
- **Reality Distortion Engine**: Hallucinated enemies, glitch physics, warped dialogues
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps gameplay despite heavy generation and reality manipulation
- **Modular Architecture**: Systems that can handle three distinct act mechanics

### Success Criteria
- **Epic Scale**: 50-70 hour campaign that feels consistently engaging
- **Psychological Impact**: Sanity system that genuinely disturbs and confuses players
- **Technical Marvel**: UI corruption and save manipulation that feels supernatural
- **Multiple Playthroughs**: Different endings and mutation paths encourage replays
- **Procedural Mastery**: Three distinct realms with unique generation algorithms
- **Mobile Performance**: All systems optimized for Android landscape gameplay

## Constraints
- **Single developer project** (ambitious but manageable with 2-3 year timeline)
- **Mobile-first development** (Android landscape orientation priority)
- **Godot 4.4 engine limitations** for complex UI manipulation
- **Performance requirements** for real-time generation across three realms
- **Touch controls** must handle complex sanity-based UI changes
- **Memory management** for 50+ hour save files on mobile devices

## Target Audience
- **Hardcore roguelike fans** seeking epic-length experiences
- **Horror game enthusiasts** who want psychological depth
- **Mobile gamers** ready for console-quality experiences
- **Procedural generation enthusiasts** 
- **Players seeking 50+ hour mobile experiences**
- **Fans of reality-bending narratives** (Silent Hill, SOMA, Amnesia)

## Project Timeline - **2-3 Year Development**
- **Phase 0**: Project Setup (Complete)
- **Phase 1**: Core Systems & Touch Controls (Current Focus)
- **Phase 2**: Act I - The Descending City Foundation
- **Phase 3**: Sanity System & UI Corruption
- **Phase 4**: Act II - The Drowning Depths
- **Phase 5**: Save System Corruption & Advanced Mechanics
- **Phase 6**: Act III - The Dream Realm
- **Phase 7**: Multiple Endings & Mutation System
- **Phase 8**: Content Expansion & Balancing
- **Phase 9**: Polish, Performance, & Mobile Optimization
- **Phase 10**: Testing, QA, & Final Balance

## Key Differentiators
- **Epic 50+ hour mobile roguelike** (unprecedented scale)
- **Reality-bending sanity system** that corrupts UI and saves
- **Three distinct acts** with unique mechanics and physics
- **Complete procedural generation** including art and audio across three realms
- **Psychological horror** that questions player perception of reality
- **Mobile-first epic experience** with console-quality depth
- **Save system as gameplay mechanic** (lies, corruption, false progress)
- **Mutation system** affecting both gameplay and story paths
