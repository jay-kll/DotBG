# Project Brief: Depths of the Bastard God

## Core Vision
A procedurally generated roguelike action game inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's work with Lovecraftian themes. Built in Godot 4.4, featuring real-time combat similar to Dead Cells but with complete procedural generation for art, sound, textures, and creatures.

## Primary Goals
1. **Atmospheric Horror**: Create a deeply unsettling experience through cosmic horror themes
2. **Procedural Everything**: Generate textures, sounds, music, and creatures procedurally
3. **Replayability**: Ensure each run feels unique through comprehensive randomization
4. **Narrative Depth**: Tell story through environmental details and emergent gameplay
5. **Technical Innovation**: Push boundaries of procedural generation in indie games

## Core Requirements

### Game Structure
- 3 Acts with 5 dungeons each (15 total dungeons)
- Endless mode for extended play
- Real-time action combat with dodge rolling and combos
- Top-down perspective similar to Dead Cells

### Key Systems
- **Sanity System**: Affects vision, perception, and reality
- **Blood Echoes Economy**: Currency system with shops every 2 dungeons
- **Mutation System**: Permanent character evolution
- **Companion System**: Rescuable NPCs with unique abilities
- **Multiple Classes**: Cultist, Warrior, Scholar with distinct playstyles

### Technical Pillars
- **Procedural Generation**: All assets generated at runtime
- **Dynamic Narrative**: Story adapts to player actions and sanity
- **Performance**: Smooth 60fps gameplay despite heavy generation
- **Modular Architecture**: Systems that can be easily extended

### Success Criteria
- Engaging combat that feels responsive and impactful
- Procedural systems that create genuinely surprising content
- Narrative that emerges naturally from gameplay
- Technical stability across different hardware configurations
- Replayability that keeps players engaged for 50+ hours

## Constraints
- Single developer project (manageable scope)
- Godot 4.4 engine limitations
- Performance requirements for real-time generation
- Art style must work with procedural generation
- Audio system must support dynamic composition

## Target Audience
- Fans of roguelike games (Dead Cells, Hades, Risk of Rain)
- Horror game enthusiasts
- Players interested in procedural generation
- Indie game supporters who appreciate technical innovation

## Project Timeline
- **Phase 0**: Project Setup (Complete)
- **Phase 1**: Core Systems (Current Focus)
- **Phase 2**: Content Foundation
- **Phase 3**: Advanced Systems
- **Phase 4**: Content Expansion
- **Phase 5**: Polish & Refinement
- **Phase 6**: Testing & Balance

## Key Differentiators
