# Project Brief: Depths of the Bastard God

## Core Vision
A massive **2.5D Gothic horror action-adventure** (2D sprites in 3D world) inspired by Castlevania's Symphony of the Night with free-exploration Metroidvania-style world design. Built in Godot 4.4 with **Hades-style perspective** (orthogonal 3D camera at ~45¬∞ angle), featuring **3D Gothic cathedral environments with 2D sprite characters** across three distinct acts. **A 50-70 hour psychological spiral through authentic 3D cathedral spaces with beautifully animated 2D sprites.**

## Primary Goals
1. **Epic Gothic Atmosphere**: Create a deeply atmospheric 50+ hour Gothic horror experience
2. **Free-Exploration World**: Metroidvania-style interconnected world where all areas remain accessible
3. **Authentic 3D Gothic Architecture + 2D Sprites**: Real 3D cathedral environments with beautifully animated 2D sprite characters
4. **Quest-Driven Backtracking**: Non-linear quest structure that leads players back to earlier areas throughout the game
5. **Hades-Style Perspective**: Perfect orthogonal 3D camera showing architectural beauty from dramatic angles
6. **Revolutionary Sanity System**: Reality-bending mechanics that corrupt visuals and question player perception

## Core Requirements

### Game Structure - The Three Acts of Gothic Horror
**üïØÔ∏è Total Runtime Target: 50+ Hours of Free-Exploration**
- **ACT I: Gothic City/Castle** (~15 hours) - Gothic architecture, stone textures, candlelight, cathedral spaces
- **ACT II: Sacred Catacombs** (~20 hours) - Bone-lined walls, ancient burial chambers, corrupted holy spaces
- **ACT III: Another Plane** (~15 hours) - Reality-breaking otherworldly realm with impossible geometries
- **Free-Exploration**: All discovered areas remain accessible throughout the entire game
- **Quest Backtracking**: Quests actively lead players back to earlier acts and areas

### Revolutionary Sanity System
**üß† Reality-Bending Visual Mechanics:**
- **High Sanity (100%)**: Clean Gothic aesthetic with beautiful cathedral vibes
- **Medium Sanity**: Colors become subtly "wrong" but Gothic foundation remains
- **Low Sanity**: Nightmare cathedral with impossible geometries
- **Zero Sanity**: Complete visual chaos, reality breakdown

### 2.5D Technical Implementation (2D Sprites in 3D World)
**üè∞ Hades-Style Perspective with 3D/2D Hybrid:**
- **Camera**: Fixed orthogonal 3D camera at ~45¬∞ angle (exactly like Hades)
- **Environments**: Real 3D cathedral spaces showing depth, lighting, and shadows
- **Characters**: High-quality 2D sprites with smooth animation
- **Movement**: Full 8-directional 2D sprite movement through 3D Gothic spaces
- **Performance**: 2D sprites much lighter than 3D models - perfect for mobile

### Key Systems
- **Free-Exploration World**: Persistent interconnected areas accessible throughout game
- **Quest System**: Non-linear objectives leading players back to earlier areas
- **Advanced Sanity System**: Visual corruption affecting 3D environment and UI
- **Gothic Architecture**: Authentic cathedral spaces, castle rooms, catacombs
- **Touch Controls**: Mobile-optimized for 3D movement and interaction
- **Multiple Endings**: Based on exploration completion and sanity management

### Technical Pillars
- **3D Gothic Environments**: Authentic cathedral architecture with dramatic lighting
- **Persistent World**: All areas remain accessible for true free-exploration
- **Dynamic Sanity Corruption**: 3D environment and UI corruption based on mental state
- **Mobile 3D Performance**: Smooth 60fps gameplay on Android landscape devices
- **Blender Integration**: Professional 3D modeling pipeline for Gothic architecture
- **Quest-Driven Design**: Non-linear progression encouraging world exploration

### Success Criteria
- **Epic Scale**: 50-70 hour free-exploration campaign across persistent Gothic world
- **Architectural Beauty**: Stunning Gothic cathedral spaces showcased by Hades-style camera
- **Psychological Impact**: Sanity system that transforms beautiful Gothic spaces into nightmares
- **Mobile Excellence**: Console-quality 3D Gothic experience optimized for mobile
- **Free-Exploration Mastery**: Seamless backtracking and area interconnection
- **Quest Integration**: Meaningful objectives that utilize the entire persistent world

## Constraints
- **Single developer project** (ambitious but manageable with 3-4 year timeline)
- **Mobile-first development** (Android landscape orientation priority)
- **Godot 4.4 3D limitations** for complex Gothic architecture
- **Performance requirements** for persistent 3D world on mobile devices
- **Touch controls** must handle 3D movement and Gothic environment interaction
- **Memory management** for large persistent 3D Gothic world on mobile

## Target Audience
- **Gothic horror enthusiasts** seeking authentic cathedral atmosphere
- **Metroidvania fans** who love free-exploration and backtracking
- **Mobile gamers** ready for console-quality 3D experiences
- **Castlevania fans** seeking modern Gothic horror adventure
- **Players seeking 50+ hour mobile experiences** with meaningful exploration
- **Fans of architectural beauty** in gaming environments

## Project Timeline - **3-4 Year Development**
- **Phase 0**: Project Setup & 3D Migration (Complete)
- **Phase 1**: Core 3D Systems & Touch Controls (Current Focus)
- **Phase 2**: Act I - Gothic City/Castle Foundation
- **Phase 3**: Free-Exploration Quest System
- **Phase 4**: Act II - Sacred Catacombs
- **Phase 5**: Sanity System & Visual Corruption
- **Phase 6**: Act III - Another Plane
- **Phase 7**: World Interconnection & Backtracking
- **Phase 8**: Multiple Endings & Content Expansion
- **Phase 9**: Polish, Performance, & Mobile Optimization
- **Phase 10**: Testing, QA, & Final Balance

## Key Differentiators
- **Epic 50+ hour 3D Gothic adventure on mobile** (unprecedented scale)
- **Authentic Hades-style perspective** showcasing Gothic architecture
- **True free-exploration world** with meaningful backtracking
- **Reality-bending sanity system** corrupting beautiful Gothic spaces
- **Quest-driven non-linear progression** utilizing entire persistent world
- **Mobile-first 3D Gothic experience** with console-quality depth
- **Castlevania-inspired atmosphere** in modern 3D implementation
