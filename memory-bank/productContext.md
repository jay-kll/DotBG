# Product Context: Depths of the Bastard God

## Why This Project Exists

### Market Gap
The roguelike genre has seen incredible success with games like Dead Cells, Hades, and Risk of Rain, but most rely on hand-crafted assets and predetermined content pools. There's an untapped opportunity for a roguelike that generates **everything** procedurally - not just levels, but textures, sounds, music, and even creature designs.

### Creative Vision
Combine the atmospheric horror of Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft with the tight gameplay loop of modern roguelikes. Create an experience where the horror comes not just from scripted scares, but from the unpredictable nature of procedural generation itself.

### Technical Innovation
Push the boundaries of what's possible with procedural generation in indie games, creating a system that can generate coherent, atmospheric content in real-time without sacrificing performance.

## Problems It Solves

### For Players
- **Content Exhaustion**: Traditional roguelikes eventually show all their content. Our procedural systems ensure truly infinite variety
- **Predictability**: Even randomized content becomes familiar. Our generation creates genuinely surprising encounters
- **Replay Value**: Each run offers not just different layouts, but different art, sounds, and creatures
- **Atmospheric Consistency**: Horror games often lose their impact on repeat playthroughs. Our sanity system ensures the horror evolves

### For the Genre
- **Technical Stagnation**: Most roguelikes use similar approaches to randomization
- **Asset Limitations**: Small teams can't create enough content for true variety
- **Narrative Constraints**: Stories become repetitive when told the same way each time

## How It Should Work

### Core Experience Loop
1. **Enter Dungeon**: Player descends into procedurally generated horror
2. **Explore & Combat**: Real-time action with evolving challenges
3. **Sanity Management**: Balance risk/reward as reality becomes unreliable
4. **Resource Collection**: Gather Blood Echoes and items
5. **Character Evolution**: Mutations and upgrades change playstyle
6. **Narrative Discovery**: Story emerges through environmental details
7. **Boss Confrontation**: Unique encounters that test all systems
8. **Progression**: Unlock new possibilities for future runs

### Player Journey
- **First Hour**: Learn basic combat and sanity mechanics
- **First 10 Hours**: Master core systems, see variety of generated content
- **First 50 Hours**: Explore all classes, mutations, and story paths
- **Beyond**: Endless mode provides infinite challenge and discovery

### Emotional Arc
- **Wonder**: Initial amazement at procedural generation
- **Mastery**: Learning to work with unpredictable systems
- **Horror**: Sanity system creates genuine unease
- **Discovery**: Finding new combinations and possibilities
- **Obsession**: "Just one more run" compulsion

## Design Principles

1. **Coherent Chaos**: Procedural systems must create content that feels intentional
2. **Meaningful Choice**: Every decision should impact the experience
3. **Emergent Horror**: Fear comes from unpredictability, not jump scares
4. **Technical Transparency**: Players should understand what's generated vs. designed
5. **Respectful Difficulty**: Challenge through skill, not frustration
