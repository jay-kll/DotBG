# Product Context: Depths of the Bastard God

## Why This Project Exists

### Market Gap
The roguelike genre has seen incredible success with games like Dead Cells, Hades, and Risk of Rain, but **no mobile roguelike has attempted a 50-70 hour epic campaign** with **hybrid procedural generation**. Most rely on either hand-crafted assets OR predetermined procedural pools. There's an untapped opportunity for a **mobile-first epic roguelike** that combines **handcrafted quality with infinite procedural variety** across **three distinct acts** with **reality-bending mechanics**.

### Creative Vision
Combine the atmospheric horror of Edgar Allan Poe and H.P. Lovecraft with the tight gameplay loop of modern roguelikes, **expanded into a massive 50+ hour psychological journey**. Create an experience where the horror comes not just from scripted scares, but from **the game itself lying to the player** through corrupted UI, false saves, and **procedural nightmare combinations** that feel both intentional and terrifying.

### Technical Innovation
Push the boundaries of what's possible with **hybrid procedural generation** and **UI manipulation** in mobile games, creating a system that can generate coherent, atmospheric content across **three distinct realms** while **corrupting the player's interface** based on their sanity state. **Handcrafted foundations ensure quality, procedural details ensure infinite variety.**

## Problems It Solves

### For Players
- **Mobile Epic Drought**: No mobile games offer 50+ hour roguelike experiences with console-quality depth
- **Content Exhaustion**: Traditional roguelikes eventually show all their content. Our **hybrid procedural systems** ensure handcrafted quality with infinite variety
- **Predictability**: Even randomized content becomes familiar. Our **tag-based procedural combinations** create genuinely surprising encounters
- **Quality vs. Variety**: Each 50+ hour run offers **handcrafted narrative quality** with **procedural mechanical variety**
- **Atmospheric Consistency**: Horror games often lose their impact on repeat playthroughs. Our **sanity-influenced procedural systems** ensure the horror evolves and deepens
- **Mobile Gaming Stigma**: Proves mobile can deliver epic, console-quality experiences with **hybrid generation quality**

### For the Genre
- **Scale Limitations**: Most roguelikes are 8-15 hour experiences. We're creating a **50-70 hour epic** with **sustainable content generation**
- **Quality vs. Variety Trade-off**: **Hybrid approach** delivers both handcrafted quality and infinite variety
- **Technical Stagnation**: No one has attempted **UI corruption as gameplay mechanic** with **procedural safety systems**
- **Platform Limitations**: Mobile roguelikes are typically simplified. We're bringing **full complexity to touch controls** with **smart procedural design**
- **Narrative Constraints**: Stories become repetitive. Our **semi-procedural lore system** creates branching narratives from handwritten pools

## How It Should Work

### Hybrid Procedural Generation Philosophy

#### **Base World Elements = Handcrafted**
- **Room layouts and flow**: Carefully designed for optimal mobile gameplay
- **Key narrative moments**: Scripted events that drive the three-act structure
- **Boss encounters**: Handcrafted mechanics with sanity-influenced variations
- **Core progression systems**: Balanced and tested advancement paths
- **UI corruption patterns**: Designed lies that feel supernatural but don't break gameplay

#### **Dungeon Interiors, Enemy Variants, Item Modifiers = Procedural**
- **Tag-based enemy generation**: [fast] + [deformed] + [fire] = unique nightmare combinations
- **Modular room templates**: "altar room", "flooded corridor", "impossible geometry"
- **Item modifier combinations**: Procedural weapon/armor enhancements with thematic coherence
- **Environmental details**: Procedural atmosphere within handcrafted spaces
- **Sanity-influenced variations**: Procedural corruption of handcrafted elements

#### **Lore Fragments = Semi-Procedural from Hand-Written Pools**
- **Curated narrative pools**: Hand-written lore fragments for quality assurance
- **Contextual selection**: Smart algorithms choose appropriate lore for current situation
- **Thematic consistency**: Procedural selection maintains three-act narrative coherence
- **Player choice influence**: Lore selection adapts to player actions and sanity state
- **Discovery variety**: Same locations can reveal different lore across playthroughs

#### **Key Events & Bosses = Scripted but Sanity-Influenced**
- **Core encounters**: Handcrafted boss mechanics ensure memorable experiences
- **Sanity variations**: Low sanity adds false phases, hallucinated attacks, UI lies
- **Procedural elements**: Tag-based modifications to scripted encounters
- **Narrative branches**: Key events adapt to player choices and mutation state
- **Reality questioning**: Scripted events may be corrupted by sanity system

### Revolutionary Tag System Architecture

#### **Enemy Tag Combinations**
```
Base Tags: [humanoid], [beast], [construct], [spirit], [amalgam]
Behavior Tags: [fast], [slow], [aggressive], [defensive], [chaotic]
Corruption Tags: [deformed], [burning], [bleeding], [mad], [false]
Element Tags: [fire], [water], [shadow], [light], [void]
Sanity Tags: [real], [hallucination], [disguised], [lying]

Example Combinations:
[humanoid] + [fast] + [deformed] + [fire] = Burning Speed Demon
[beast] + [defensive] + [bleeding] + [shadow] = Wounded Shadow Guardian
[spirit] + [chaotic] + [mad] + [false] = Insane Phantom (may not exist)
```

#### **Item Tag System**
```
Base Types: [weapon], [armor], [consumable], [key], [lore]
Quality Tags: [crude], [fine], [masterwork], [cursed], [blessed]
Effect Tags: [sharp], [heavy], [light], [poisoned], [burning]
Mutation Tags: [organic], [mechanical], [ethereal], [corrupted]
Sanity Tags: [real], [false], [lying], [changing]

Example Combinations:
[weapon] + [masterwork] + [burning] + [organic] = Living Flame Blade
[armor] + [cursed] + [heavy] + [corrupted] = Nightmare Plate Mail
[consumable] + [false] + [lying] = Potion That Claims to Heal (but doesn't)
```

### Modular Room Template System

#### **Template Categories**
- **Functional Rooms**: "altar room", "shop chamber", "save shrine", "boss arena"
- **Atmospheric Rooms**: "flooded corridor", "collapsed ceiling", "whispering gallery"
- **Mechanical Rooms**: "puzzle chamber", "trap gauntlet", "platforming challenge"
- **Narrative Rooms**: "lore library", "memory fragment", "vision chamber"
- **Corruption Rooms**: "impossible geometry", "lying walls", "false exits"

#### **Template Variations per Act**
- **Act I (City)**: Urban templates with architectural horror
- **Act II (Depths)**: Organic templates with water hazards
- **Act III (Dream)**: Impossible templates with reality distortion

### Safety and Quality Assurance Systems

#### **Failsafe Checkers**
- **Softlock Prevention**: Ensure every room has valid exit paths
- **Progression Validation**: Verify required items/abilities are obtainable
- **Performance Monitoring**: Check generation doesn't exceed mobile limits
- **Narrative Coherence**: Validate lore selections make thematic sense
- **Sanity Corruption Limits**: Ensure UI lies don't break core functionality

#### **Debug and Monitoring**
- **Generation Logging**: "Why did this nightmare just spawn 4 priests inside a ladder?"
- **Tag Validation**: Ensure tag combinations produce sensible results
- **Performance Profiling**: Monitor generation time and memory usage
- **Quality Metrics**: Track player engagement with procedural content
- **Corruption Tracking**: Monitor sanity system impact on gameplay

## Epic Three-Act Structure (Hybrid Approach)

- **Handcrafted**: Urban layout, key story beats, major landmarks
- **Procedural**: Building interiors, enemy variants, item modifiers
- **Semi-Procedural**: Urban lore fragments, citizen backstories
- **Tag Focus**: [humanoid], [deformed], [mad] combinations for corrupted citizens

#### **ACT II: The Drowning Depths** (~20 hours)
- **Handcrafted**: Dungeon structure, water physics, major encounters
- **Procedural**: Room details, body-horror combinations, organic growth
- **Semi-Procedural**: Depths lore, creature origins, water memories
- **Tag Focus**: [beast], [amalgam], [bleeding], [water] for fusion horrors

#### **ACT III: The Dream Realm** (~15 hours)
- **Handcrafted**: Impossible geometry rules, reality distortion mechanics
- **Procedural**: Dream logic variations, hallucinated content, false environments
- **Semi-Procedural**: Dream narratives, memory fragments, reality questions
- **Tag Focus**: [spirit], [false], [lying], [chaotic] for reality breakdown
