# Active Context: Depths of the Bastard God

## Current Work Focus

### Phase 1: Core Systems Implementation
We are currently in **Phase 1** of development, focusing on establishing the foundational systems that will support all other game features.

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Parse Error Resolution**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fixed signal naming conflict in player_stats.gd
2. **Mobile Landscape Configuration**: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated project for mobile landscape development
3. **PRD Update**: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated PRD to reflect mobile landscape touch controls
4. **Documentation Update**: ✅ COMPLETED - Updated .cursorrules with mobile landscape requirements
5. **Core System Architecture**: Need to implement basic player movement and combat framework
6. **Touch Control System**: Implement virtual joystick and touch buttons for landscape layout

## Recent Changes

### Just Completed (This Session)
- **Signal Naming Fix**: Fixed naming conflict between `level_up` signal and `level_up()` function
  - Renamed signal to `level_up_achieved` to avoid conflict
- **Mobile Landscape Configuration**: Updated project.godot for Android mobile landscape development
  - Changed to landscape orientation (1920x1080)
  - Removed desktop keyboard/mouse input mappings
  - Set mobile renderer and compression
  - Configured for touch input only
- **PRD Mobile Landscape Update**: Completely revised PRD to focus on landscape touch controls
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated .cursorrules with prominent mobile landscape requirements
- **Platform Clarification**: Established mobile landscape as ONLY target until desktop explicitly requested

### Platform Requirements (CRITICAL)
- **Primary Target**: Android mobile devices (LANDSCAPE orientation ONLY)
- **Input Method**: Touch controls ONLY (virtual joystick, touch buttons)
- **NO Desktop Support**: Until explicitly requested by user
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 landscape optimized
- **Renderer**: Mobile renderer with ETC2/ASTC compression

## Next Steps

### Immediate (This Session)
1. **Generate Mobile Landscape Tasks**: Use TaskMaster to create landscape-focused task breakdown
2. **Touch Control System**: Implement virtual joystick and touch buttons for landscape
3. **Mobile Player Movement**: Create touch-based character controller optimized for landscape

### Short-term (Next Few Sessions)
1. **Mobile Landscape UI Framework**: Touch-optimized interface systems for landscape layout
2. **World Generation**: Mobile-optimized room generation system
3. **Enemy Framework**: Mobile-optimized enemy AI and behavior
4. **Performance Optimization**: Mobile-specific performance considerations

### Medium-term (Next Week)
1. **Touch Combat System**: Tap/hold attack mechanics for landscape layout
2. **Mobile Audio Framework**: Optimized for mobile devices
3. **Mobile Save System**: Handle mobile app lifecycle
4. **Battery Optimization**: Efficient rendering and processing

## Active Decisions

### Platform Architecture (MOBILE LANDSCAPE ONLY)
- **Android Primary**: Targeting API level 21+ for broad compatibility
- **Landscape Orientation**: Optimized for two-handed landscape play
- **Touch Controls**: Virtual joystick + touch buttons as ONLY input
- **Mobile Renderer**: Using Godot's mobile rendering pipeline
- **NO Desktop**: Until user explicitly requests it

### Technical Choices
- **Touch Responsiveness**: Target <50ms input latency
- **Memory Constraints**: Keep under 1.5GB RAM usage
- **Performance**: 60 FPS on mid-range Android devices
- **Battery Optimization**: Efficient background processing

### Design Adaptations (Landscape Layout)
- **Touch-First Combat**: Tap/hold variations for attacks
- **Landscape Mobile UI**: Larger touch targets, landscape-optimized interfaces
- **Gesture Support**: Swipe patterns for special abilities across landscape screen
- **Two-Handed Play**: Comfortable control layout for landscape orientation

## Current Challenges

### Mobile Landscape Technical
- **Performance Optimization**: Ensuring smooth generation on mobile GPU/CPU
- **Memory Management**: Handling procedural content within mobile constraints
- **Touch Precision**: Making landscape touch controls feel responsive and accurate
- **Battery Life**: Optimizing for extended landscape play sessions

### Mobile Landscape Design
- **Screen Layout**: Optimizing UI for landscape mobile screens
- **Touch Ergonomics**: Comfortable control placement for landscape orientation
- **Visual Clarity**: Readable text and UI on landscape mobile screens
- **Accessibility**: Supporting various hand sizes and landscape play styles

### Development
- **Mobile Testing**: Testing across different Android devices in landscape
- **Performance Profiling**: Mobile-specific optimization
- **Touch Debugging**: Ensuring reliable touch input in landscape
- **Platform Differences**: Handling Android variations

## Key Considerations

### Mobile Landscape User Experience
- Players should understand landscape touch controls within 2 minutes
- Comfortable two-handed landscape play experience
- Haptic feedback for important interactions
- Graceful handling of app interruptions (calls, notifications)

### Technical Constraints
- Target 60fps on mid-range Android devices
- Memory usage under 1.5GB
- Generation time under 1 second per room
- Touch responsiveness under 50ms latency
- Battery optimization for 2+ hour landscape sessions

### Development Workflow
- Use TaskMaster for mobile landscape-focused task tracking
- Maintain Memory Bank for session continuity
- Regular testing on actual Android devices in landscape
- Iterative approach to landscape touch control refinement

## Session Goals

### Today's Objectives
1. ✅ Fix parse errors in Godot project
2. ✅ Update project configuration for mobile landscape
3. ✅ Revise PRD for mobile landscape approach
4. ✅ Update Memory Bank to reflect mobile landscape focus
5. ✅ Update .cursorrules with mobile landscape requirements
6. Generate mobile landscape-focused task list via TaskMaster
7. Begin mobile landscape touch control implementation

### Success Criteria
- All parse errors resolved
- Project configured for Android landscape development
- TaskMaster operational with mobile landscape-focused tasks
- Touch control foundation implemented for landscape
- Clear mobile landscape development path established

## Mobile Landscape Development Notes

### Touch Control Layout (Landscape)
- **Bottom Left**: Virtual joystick for movement
- **Bottom Right**: Attack button (primary action)
- **Right Side**: Dodge/roll button (above attack)
- **Top Corners**: Menu/inventory buttons
- **Context Sensitive**: Interact button appears when needed

### Performance Considerations
- Object pooling essential for mobile memory management
- LOD system for distant objects
- Efficient particle systems
- Texture compression for mobile storage
- Audio streaming for memory efficiency

### Platform Integration
- Handle Android app lifecycle (pause/resume)
- Support for Android back button
- Integration with Android notifications
- Proper handling of phone calls/interruptions
- Battery usage optimization for landscape play

## Critical Reminders

### MOBILE LANDSCAPE ONLY
- **NO desktop support** until user explicitly requests it
- **Touch controls are the ONLY input method**
- **Landscape orientation is MANDATORY**
- **Mobile performance is the PRIMARY concern**
- **Test on mobile devices/emulation regularly**

### Recent Fixes Applied
- ✅ Fixed `level_up` signal naming conflict
- ✅ Configured project for mobile landscape
- ✅ Updated all documentation for mobile landscape focus
- ✅ Removed desktop input mappings
- ✅ Set mobile renderer and compression
