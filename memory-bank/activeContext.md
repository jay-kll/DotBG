# Active Context: Depths of the Bastard God

## Current Work Focus

### âœ… MASSIVE SCOPE EXPANSION COMPLETED âœ…
**Status**: Successfully updated all project documentation and TaskMaster for **hybrid procedural approach**
- **Previous scope**: 15-20 dungeons, 8-12 hours gameplay, basic procedural generation
- **NEW SCOPE**: **50-70 hour epic campaign** across **three acts** with **hybrid procedural generation**
- **Hybrid Approach**: **Handcrafted foundations + Procedural details + Semi-procedural lore**
- **Completed**: Memory Bank updated, TaskMaster expanded with 23 new epic tasks (Tasks 26-48)

### Immediate Priorities (Session Focus)
1. âœ… **Update Memory Bank** - Reflecting new hybrid procedural scope and three-act structure
2. âœ… **Expand TaskMaster** - Added 23 new tasks for hybrid systems (Tasks 26-48)
3. âœ… **Document Hybrid Architecture** - Updated system patterns for hybrid approach
4. ðŸ”„ **Begin implementation** - Ready to start with next task from TaskMaster

### Revolutionary Hybrid Approach Established
- **Base World Elements**: Handcrafted for quality (room layouts, key events, boss mechanics)
- **Procedural Details**: Tag-based generation ([fast] + [deformed] + [fire] = unique combinations)
- **Semi-Procedural Lore**: Curated narrative pools with contextual selection
- **Safety Systems**: Comprehensive failsafe checkers ("Why did this nightmare spawn 4 priests inside a ladder?")
- **Mobile Optimization**: All systems designed for 50+ hour mobile campaigns

### New Task Categories Added
- **Core Hybrid Systems** (Tasks 41-44): Foundation, tag system, templates, safety
- **Epic Campaign Systems** (Tasks 26-40): Sanity, UI corruption, three acts, endings
- **Quality Assurance** (Tasks 45-48): Lore system, validation, analytics

### Current Development Status
- **Total Tasks**: 48 (previously 25)
- **Completion**: 2% of epic scope (Task 1 complete)
- **Next Priority**: Task 2 - Touch Input System (blocking other development)
- **Epic Timeline**: 2-3 years for full 50-70 hour experience

## Recent Changes and Discoveries

### Hybrid Procedural Architecture
- **Quality + Variety**: Handcrafted foundations ensure quality, procedural details ensure infinite variety
- **Tag System Innovation**: Revolutionary approach to enemy/item generation with validation
- **Template System**: Modular room generation with act-specific variations
- **Safety First**: Comprehensive failsafe systems prevent game-breaking combinations

### Three-Act Epic Structure
- **Act I: The Descending City** (~15 hours) - Semi-open urban exploration
- **Act II: The Drowning Depths** (~20 hours) - Dungeon-crawl with water hazards
- **Act III: The Dream Realm** (~15 hours) - Reality distortion and impossible geometry

### Mobile-First Epic Design
- **50+ Hour Campaigns**: Unprecedented scope for mobile roguelikes
- **Touch Controls**: All systems designed for mobile landscape orientation
- **Performance Scaling**: Adaptive systems for different mobile hardware
- **Battery Optimization**: Extended session support for epic campaigns

## Next Steps

### Immediate Implementation Focus
1. **Complete Touch Input System** (Task 2) - Currently blocking other development
2. **Begin Hybrid System Implementation** (Task 41) - Core hybrid architecture
3. **Implement Tag System** (Task 42) - Revolutionary generation approach
4. **Create Safety Systems** (Task 44) - Prevent game-breaking combinations

### Development Workflow
- **Mobile Testing**: Regular testing on Android devices/emulation
- **Hybrid Validation**: Ensure generated content maintains handcrafted feel
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track mobile performance during extended sessions
- **Quality Assurance**: Validate safety systems prevent all major issues

### Documentation Maintenance
- **Memory Bank**: Keep updated with hybrid system discoveries
- **TaskMaster**: Track progress through epic scope tasks
- **System Patterns**: Document hybrid architecture patterns as they emerge
- **Mobile Optimization**: Track performance optimizations and battery usage

## Key Decisions Made

### Hybrid Approach Adoption
- **Quality Preservation**: Handcrafted foundations maintain narrative and mechanical quality
- **Infinite Variety**: Procedural details ensure no two 50+ hour runs feel identical
- **Safety Engineering**: Comprehensive validation prevents procedural disasters
- **Mobile Optimization**: All systems designed for mobile constraints and extended sessions

### Epic Scope Commitment
- **50-70 Hour Campaigns**: Massive scope unprecedented for mobile roguelikes
- **Three-Act Structure**: Distinct acts with unique mechanics and themes
- **Multiple Endings**: Four endings reflecting player's epic journey
- **Reality Distortion**: Sanity system affects UI, saves, and player perception

### Technical Architecture
- **Event-Driven Design**: EventBus coordinates all hybrid systems
- **Autoload Pattern**: Core systems as autoloads for global access
- **Component Composition**: Modular entity design for flexibility
- **Mobile Performance**: All systems optimized for mobile hardware constraints

## Current Challenges

### Technical Complexity
- **Hybrid System Coordination**: Managing handcrafted + procedural integration
- **Mobile Performance**: Maintaining 60 FPS during complex generation
- **Epic Scope Management**: Coordinating 48 tasks across 2-3 year timeline
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensuring procedural content maintains handcrafted feel

### Design Balance
- **Quality vs. Variety**: Balancing handcrafted quality with procedural variety
- **Safety vs. Creativity**: Preventing softlocks while allowing creative combinations
- **Mobile vs. Complexity**: Delivering epic scope within mobile constraints
- **Horror vs. Playability**: Maintaining horror atmosphere without breaking gameplay

### Development Sustainability
- **Solo Development**: Managing epic scope as single developer
- **Documentation Maintenance**: Keeping comprehensive docs updated
- **Testing Coverage**: Validating hybrid systems across all scenarios
- **Performance Optimization**: Continuous mobile performance monitoring

## Success Metrics

### Hybrid System Quality
