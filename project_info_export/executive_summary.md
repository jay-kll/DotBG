# Executive Summary: Depths of the Bastard God

## Project Vision
"Depths of the Bastard God" is a free-exploration Gothic horror game designed exclusively for mobile devices. It combines the atmospheric aesthetic of classic Castlevania with a modern, non-linear, quest-driven world. The core experience is built on a foundation of procedural generation, ensuring that every playthrough offers unique environments, creatures, and challenges within a persistent, interconnected world.

## Target Platform
-   **Device:** Android Mobile Devices
-   **Orientation:** Landscape ONLY
-   **Input:** Touch Controls ONLY (Virtual Joystick + Buttons)

## Core Pillars
1.  **Non-Linear Exploration:** Unlike traditional "Soulsvania" games, this is not a linear progression. Quests are designed to lead players back to previously explored areas, creating a deeply interconnected and replayable world where discovery is paramount.
2.  **Total Procedural Generation:** The game world, including its art, sound, textures, and creatures, is generated at runtime. This provides infinite variety and ensures no two journeys into the depths are the same, all while being optimized for mobile performance.
3.  **Atmospheric Horror:** A central "Sanity" system directly impacts gameplay, causing visual distortions and audio hallucinations. This is interwoven with themes of **Gothic, Cosmic, and Religious Horror**, exploring decay, forbidden knowledge, and the perversion of faith to create a tense, psychological experience.
4.  **Mobile-First Excellence:** Every design and technical decision is made with the mobile experience as the priority. This includes highly responsive touch controls, optimized performance targeting 60 FPS, and a user interface designed for clarity on smaller screens.

## Unique Selling Proposition
"Depths of the Bastard God" fills a niche in the mobile market for a high-quality, deeply engaging action-horror game that respects the player. By rejecting linear design in favor of true exploration and leveraging procedural generation for endless replayability, it offers a console-like experience tailored perfectly for the mobile platform. Its unique Sanity system and rich, Gothic world—infused with cosmic and religious dread—provide a compelling hook for fans of horror and action RPGs seeking a substantial and challenging adventure on the go.
