## 1. Core Principles

-   **Atmospheric & Immersive:** The UI must complement the Gothic horror theme, never breaking player immersion. It should feel like an organic part of the world.
-   **Mobile-First Clarity:** Every element must be clear, readable, and functional on a range of mobile screen sizes (from 5" to 7"). Readability is prioritized over ornate, illegible design.
-   **Touch-Centric:** All interactive elements must be designed for touch input, with large, easy-to-tap hitboxes to minimize missed inputs during intense gameplay.

## 2. Art Style & Aesthetics

-   **Primary Influence:** Classic Castlevania, with a dark, brooding, and oppressive Gothic atmosphere.
-   **Visuals:** The game uses a 3D orthogonal perspective (~45Â° angle) to create a "2.5D" look. Environments are characterized by grand, decaying cathedral-like structures, deep shadows, and stark, dramatic lighting. The architecture will incorporate unsettling, blasphemous iconography that warps traditional religious symbols.
-   **Color Palette:**
    -   **Dominant:** Desaturated tones, deep blacks, cool grays, stone textures, and muted blues and purples.
    -   **Accent Colors:** Used sparingly but effectively to draw the player's eye. A vibrant, deep crimson for blood and "Blood Echoes," an ethereal, sickly green or violet for sanity-related effects and poison, and a warm gold for item highlights and checkpoints.
-   **Lighting:** High-contrast, dynamic lighting is crucial. Expect deep, ominous shadows punctuated by sources of light like torches, lanterns, and magical effects, creating a sense of dread and mystery.

## 3. UI Layout (Mobile Landscape)

The screen is organized to maximize the gameplay view while providing essential information and intuitive controls.

-   **Left Side of Screen:**
    -   **Virtual Joystick:** A dynamic, context-aware virtual joystick for player movement. It appears wherever the player first places their thumb, providing flexibility and comfort. It is semi-transparent to avoid obscuring the view.
-   **Right Side of Screen:**
    -   **Action Buttons:** A cluster of large, distinct buttons for core combat actions.
        -   **Primary Attack:** The largest, most central button.
        -   **Dodge Roll:** Positioned conveniently near the attack button.
        -   **Interact/Contextual Action:** A multi-purpose button.
        -   **Weapon/Ability Buttons:** Smaller buttons for equipped mutations or special weapons.
-   **Top of Screen (HUD):**
    -   **Top-Left:**
        -   **Health Bar:** A clear, visual representation of the player's health.
        -   **Sanity Bar:** Positioned below or next to the health bar, visually distinct (e.g., different color or texture) to show the player's current sanity level.
    -   **Top-Right:**
        -   **Blood Echoes Count:** A numerical display of the player's current currency.
        -   **Pause/Menu Button:** A small, non-intrusive icon (e.g., a cog or gear) to access the game menu.
-   **Pop-ups & Notifications:** Item pickups and quest updates appear briefly at the bottom-center of the screen with a clean, unobtrusive animation.

## 4. Typography & Iconography

-   **Fonts:**
    -   **Headings/Titles:** A thematic, slightly stylized Gothic or serif font that is still highly readable (e.g., Cinzel, Uncial Antiqua).
    -   **Body Text/UI Elements:** A clean, clear sans-serif font (e.g., Lato, Open Sans) for maximum readability of descriptions, stats, and menu options.
-   **Iconography:** Icons will be simple, clear, and high-contrast to be easily recognizable at a small size. They will follow the game's aesthetic (e.g., stylized skulls, weapons, arcane symbols) but prioritize clarity over intricate detail.
