## About The Project

**"Depths of the Bastard God"** is a free-exploration Gothic horror game designed exclusively for mobile devices. It combines the atmospheric aesthetic of classic Castlevania with a modern, non-linear, quest-driven world. The core experience is built on a foundation of procedural generation, ensuring that every playthrough offers unique environments, creatures, and challenges within a persistent, interconnected world.

This repository contains the full source code and project files for the game, built with the Godot Engine.

## Core Features

-   **Non-Linear Exploration:** Rejecting a linear path, the game uses a quest-driven structure that encourages backtracking and discovery within a persistent, interconnected world.
-   **Total Procedural Generation:** The game world, including its art, sound, textures, and creatures, is generated at runtime for infinite variety, all while being optimized for mobile performance.
-   **Atmospheric Horror:** A central "Sanity" system directly impacts gameplay through visual and auditory hallucinations. The narrative is a blend of **Gothic, Cosmic, and Religious Horror**, exploring themes of decay, forbidden knowledge, and the perversion of faith.
-   **Real-Time Combat:** Fast-paced, challenging combat tailored for touchscreens, featuring dodge-rolling, combos, and a variety of status effects.
-   **Deep Progression:** A permanent **Mutation System** allows for powerful character evolution, alongside a **Blood Echoes** economy with a high-risk/high-reward "Black Market" that costs Sanity instead of currency.
