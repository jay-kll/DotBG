# Depths of the Bastard God - Design Document

## Lore
The Bastard God, a cosmic entity born from the forbidden union of mortal and divine, lies dormant beneath an ancient city. Its dreams seep into reality, corrupting all they touch. As its awakening draws near, the city's architecture twists into impossible geometries, and its inhabitants transform into grotesque reflections of their former selves. You, marked by eldritch knowledge, must descend through the nightmare-warped ruins to prevent the Bastard God's full emergence into our realm.
