# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Multiple Endings System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 29, 30, 31
# Priority: medium
# Description: Four distinct endings based on player choices, sanity levels, and campaign progression: Transcendence, Corruption, Sacrifice, and hidden endings. Each ending reflects the player's 50+ hour journey.
# Details:
1. Create EndingManager class for tracking ending conditions
2. Implement Transcendence ending (high sanity, high companion survival)
3. Create Corruption ending (low sanity, mutation embrace)
4. Implement Sacrifice ending (any sanity, full lore, great cost)
5. Add hidden ending conditions and triggers
6. Create ending-specific cutscenes and narrative content
7. Implement ending choice tracking throughout campaign
8. Add ending replay system for completionist players
9. Create ending statistics and achievement integration
10. Balance ending requirements for epic campaign scope

# Test Strategy:
Test all ending conditions trigger correctly after 50+ hour campaigns. Verify ending choices reflect player's journey. Validate ending content quality and narrative satisfaction.
