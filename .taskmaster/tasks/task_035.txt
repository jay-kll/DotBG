# Task ID: 35
# Title: Implement Act III: The Dream Realm
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 26, 27, 28, 34
# Priority: medium
# Description: Final act of the epic campaign (~15 hours). Broken logic with looping maps, time skips, and lying items. Features reality distortion, hallucinated enemies, and The Bastard God final boss shaped by player's sanity and choices.
# Details:
1. Create impossible geometry generation for dream logic
2. Implement map looping and non-Euclidean navigation
3. Add time skip mechanics and temporal distortion
4. Create item lying system (descriptions and effects change)
5. Implement hallucinated enemy system (fake encounters)
6. Add glitch physics and warped dialogue systems
7. Design and implement The Bastard God final boss (sanity-dependent)
8. Create reality distortion visual and audio effects
9. Implement dream-specific environmental storytelling
