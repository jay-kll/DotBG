# Task ID: 41
# Title: Implement Hybrid Procedural Generation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 29
# Priority: high
# Description: Core hybrid system combining handcrafted foundations with procedural details. Base world elements are handcrafted, while dungeon interiors, enemy variants, and item modifiers are procedural.
# Details:
1. Create HybridGenerator autoload for coordinating handcrafted + procedural systems
2. Implement HandcraftedManager for base templates and foundations
3. Create ProceduralManager for detail generation and variations
4. Add hybrid content serialization and deserialization
5. Implement hybrid generation pipeline with quality validation
6. Create hybrid content caching for mobile performance
7. Add hybrid generation debugging and monitoring tools
8. Implement hybrid content streaming for epic campaigns
9. Create hybrid generation metrics and quality tracking
10. Document hybrid architecture for team understanding

# Test Strategy:
Test hybrid generation maintains handcrafted quality with infinite variety. Verify generation performance meets mobile requirements. Validate hybrid content feels coherent and intentional.
