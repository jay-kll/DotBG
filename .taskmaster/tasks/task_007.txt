## 3. Create Damage Calculation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2
### Description: Build a flexible damage system with modifiers and resistance calculations
### Details:
Implement base damage values, scaling factors, and defense calculations. Create a damage type system (physical, magical, etc.). Add support for damage-over-time effects. Ensure calculations are lightweight for mobile performance.

## 4. Develop Animation Controller [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a responsive animation system for attack sequences
### Details:
Implement animation state transitions for attack phases. Add support for animation canceling. Optimize animation assets for mobile devices. Create animation events to trigger effects, sounds, and hit detection at precise frames.

## 5. Design Touch Input System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create an intuitive touch control scheme for combat
### Details:
Implement gesture recognition for different attack types. Add support for tap, swipe, and hold inputs. Create visual feedback for touch inputs. Ensure controls are responsive with minimal latency on various mobile devices.

## 6. Implement Combo System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.4, 7.5
### Description: Develop a flexible combo system with timing windows
### Details:
Create a combo chain system with timing windows. Implement combo state tracking and validation. Add visual indicators for combo opportunities. Design a data-driven approach to define combo sequences that can be easily balanced.

## 7. Create Cooldown Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.5
### Description: Implement a system to handle ability cooldowns and resource costs
### Details:
Develop a timer system for tracking cooldowns. Create visual indicators for cooldown status. Implement resource cost validation before attacks. Optimize the system to minimize performance impact on mobile devices.

## 8. Design Weapon Data Structure [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Create a flexible data system for weapon properties and behaviors
### Details:
Implement a scriptable object system for weapon definitions. Include properties for damage, range, speed, and special effects. Create a weapon switching mechanism. Design the system to be easily extensible for future weapon types.

## 9. Implement Combat Feedback System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.2, 7.3, 7.4
### Description: Create visual and audio feedback for combat actions
### Details:
Add hit effects, particles, and screen shake. Implement sound effects for attacks, hits, and misses. Create damage number popups. Optimize effects for mobile performance with quality scaling options.

## 10. Develop Critical Hit System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.3, 7.9
### Description: Implement critical hit mechanics with special effects
### Details:
Create critical hit chance and damage multiplier calculations. Add enhanced visual and audio feedback for critical hits. Implement critical hit notifications. Design the system to be balanced and not overpowered.

## 11. Implement Directional Attack System [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2, 7.5
### Description: Create a system for directional attacks and blocking
### Details:
