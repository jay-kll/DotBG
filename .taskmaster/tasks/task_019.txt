# Test Strategy:
Test save and load functionality with various game states. Verify data integrity after loading. Test auto-save during interruptions. Measure save file size and save/load performance on target devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement SaveManager class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a central SaveManager class to handle all save-related operations
### Details:
Design a singleton SaveManager class with methods for saving, loading, and managing game states. Implement thread-safe operations and error handling.

## 2. Develop serialization system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1
### Description: Create a robust serialization system for game state data
### Details:
Implement custom serialization methods for complex game objects. Ensure backward compatibility for future updates. Use efficient encoding to minimize save file size.

## 3. Implement file handling operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.2
### Description: Create methods for reading and writing save files to device storage
### Details:
Develop platform-specific file I/O operations. Implement asynchronous file operations to prevent UI freezing. Add error handling and recovery mechanisms.

## 4. Create data validation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.3
### Description: Implement a system to validate save data integrity and detect corruptions
### Details:
Design checksum algorithms for data validation. Implement data structure checks and type validation. Create a system to handle and recover from corrupted save data.

## 5. Develop auto-save functionality [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3
### Description: Implement an automatic saving system with configurable intervals
### Details:
Create a background auto-save system with customizable frequency. Implement intelligent auto-save triggers based on game events. Ensure auto-saves don't impact game performance.

## 6. Implement save versioning system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.4
### Description: Create a versioning system for save files to handle game updates
### Details:
Design a version tagging system for save files. Implement migration methods for updating old save formats. Create fallback mechanisms for incompatible versions.

## 7. Develop save file encryption [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3
### Description: Implement encryption for save files to prevent tampering
### Details:
Choose and implement a suitable encryption algorithm. Develop key management system for encryption/decryption. Ensure encryption doesn't significantly impact save/load times.

## 8. Create backup system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.3, 19.7
### Description: Implement a backup system for save files
### Details:
Design a system for creating and managing multiple backups. Implement automatic backup creation at key game points. Develop a user interface for managing and restoring backups.

## 9. Implement save slot management [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3
### Description: Create a system for managing multiple save slots
### Details:
Develop a UI for creating, selecting, and deleting save slots. Implement thumbnail generation for save slots. Create a system for copying and moving save data between slots.

## 10. Develop save metadata system [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.2, 19.9
### Description: Implement a system for storing and retrieving metadata for save files
### Details:
Design a metadata structure including timestamps, play time, and game progress. Implement methods for updating and querying metadata. Create a sorting and filtering system based on metadata.

## 11. Implement cloud save integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 19.1, 19.3, 19.7
### Description: Develop a system for syncing save data with cloud storage
### Details:
Integrate with platform-specific cloud storage APIs. Implement conflict resolution for cloud saves. Develop offline mode and sync queue for intermittent connectivity.
