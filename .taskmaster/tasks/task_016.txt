## 2. Implement Health, Sanity, and Echoes Displays [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Develop and integrate UI components for displaying health, sanity, and echoes, optimized for mobile screen sizes.
### Details:
Use scalable vector graphics and responsive layouts to ensure clarity and consistency across devices.

## 3. Develop Status Indicators [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create status indicator components (e.g., buffs, debuffs, alerts) that are visually distinct and easily readable on mobile devices.
### Details:
Design icons and animations for each status effect, ensuring accessibility and minimal screen clutter.

## 4. Design and Implement Quick Slots [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Add quick slot UI elements for fast item or ability access, supporting drag-and-drop and touch interactions.
### Details:
Ensure quick slots are positioned for ergonomic access and support dynamic resizing for different device resolutions.

## 5. Integrate Scaling and Responsive Layouts [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.2, 16.3, 16.4
### Description: Implement responsive scaling for all HUD elements to adapt to various mobile screen sizes and aspect ratios.
### Details:
Test layouts on multiple devices and orientations, adjusting padding, margins, and element sizes as needed.

## 6. Add Opacity and Visibility Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Enable dynamic opacity adjustments and auto-hide features for HUD elements to reduce visual clutter during gameplay.
### Details:
Provide user settings for manual opacity control and implement context-sensitive visibility (e.g., fade out during cutscenes).

## 7. Implement HUD Animations [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.5
### Description: Add smooth animations for HUD transitions, notifications, and feedback (e.g., health loss, status changes).
### Details:
Use lightweight animation techniques to maintain performance on mobile devices.

### Details:
Develop a settings menu for HUD customization and save user preferences persistently.

## 9. Optimize HUD Performance for Mobile [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile and optimize HUD rendering and update logic to minimize CPU/GPU usage and battery drain on mobile devices.
### Details:
Reduce draw calls, use efficient UI batching, and avoid unnecessary updates when HUD elements are static.

## 10. Implement Touch Controls and Accessibility [pending]
### Dependencies: 16.8, 16.9
### Description: Ensure all HUD elements are fully operable via touch, with appropriate hitboxes and accessibility features (e.g., screen reader support).
### Details:
Test touch interactions for accuracy and comfort, and provide alternative input options where possible.

## 11. Conduct Usability Testing and Iterative Refinement [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Perform user testing sessions to gather feedback on HUD usability, clarity, and performance, iterating on design as needed.
### Details:
Use analytics, surveys, and direct observation to identify pain points and opportunities for improvement.
