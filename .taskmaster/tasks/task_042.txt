# Task ID: 42
# Title: Implement Tag System Architecture
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 14
# Priority: high
# Description: Revolutionary tag-based system for enemy and item generation. Tags like [fast], [deformed], [fire] combine to create unique nightmare combinations with validation and safety checks.
# Details:
1. Create TagSystem autoload for managing tag combinations and validation
2. Implement tag categories (Base, Behavior, Corruption, Element, Sanity, Quality, Effect, Mutation)
3. Add TagValidator for combination rules and forbidden/required combinations
4. Create tag-based entity generation from combinations
5. Implement tag combination caching for mobile performance
6. Add tag system debugging and visualization tools
7. Create tag balance validation and testing systems
8. Implement tag combination metrics and analytics
9. Add tag system documentation and examples
10. Optimize tag processing for mobile CPU constraints

# Test Strategy:
Test tag combinations create sensible and engaging entities. Verify forbidden combinations are properly blocked. Validate tag system performance with complex combinations.
