# Task ID: 34
# Title: Implement Act II: The Drowning Depths
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 29, 26, 31, 33
# Priority: medium
# Description: Second act of the epic campaign (~20 hours). Dungeon-crawl with water hazards and sentient environments. Features Amalgam Mother boss (entire dungeon is part of her body). Black Market opens, betrayal events begin.
# Details:
1. Create water physics system for drowning hazards
2. Implement sentient environment mechanics (living dungeons)
3. Design and implement Amalgam Mother boss (dungeon-sized entity)
4. Create water-based environmental puzzles and challenges
5. Implement Black Market system activation (low sanity requirement)
6. Add betrayal event system with companion NPCs
7. Create depths-specific enemy types (body-horror fusions, liquid memories)
8. Implement organic dungeon generation algorithms
9. Add underwater/flooded area exploration mechanics
10. Balance Act II progression for ~20 hour experience

# Test Strategy:
Test water physics work correctly on mobile devices. Verify Amalgam Mother boss feels like fighting a living dungeon. Validate Act II provides ~20 hours of distinct content.
