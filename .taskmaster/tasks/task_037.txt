# Task ID: 37
# Title: Implement Epic Mobile Performance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 29, 26
# Priority: high
# Description: Advanced performance optimization system designed for 50-70 hour mobile campaigns. Includes memory management for three acts, battery optimization for extended sessions, and performance scaling.
# Details:
1. Extend PerformanceManager for epic campaign requirements
2. Implement act-specific memory management and cleanup
3. Create battery optimization for 60+ minute mobile sessions
4. Add performance scaling based on campaign progress
5. Implement thermal management for extended mobile play
6. Create memory leak detection for long campaign sessions
7. Add performance metrics tracking for epic campaigns
8. Implement adaptive quality settings for device capabilities
9. Create session length optimization for mobile gaming
10. Add performance debugging tools for epic scope development

# Test Strategy:
Test performance remains stable during 60+ minute mobile sessions. Verify memory usage doesn't grow excessively over 50+ hour campaigns. Validate battery optimization extends play time.
