# Task ID: 40
# Title: Implement Epic Audio System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21, 26, 29, 37
# Priority: medium
# Description: Massive audio system for 50-70 hour campaigns with procedural music, sanity-based audio distortion, and three-act specific soundscapes. Optimized for mobile audio processing and battery efficiency.
# Details:
1. Extend AudioManager for epic campaign requirements
2. Implement procedural music generation for massive soundtrack
3. Add sanity-based audio distortion and hallucination effects
4. Create act-specific soundscape generation and themes
5. Implement audio streaming for large soundtrack files
6. Add audio compression optimization for mobile storage
7. Create audio memory management for extended sessions
8. Implement spatial audio for three-act environments
9. Add audio corruption effects tied to sanity system
10. Optimize audio processing for mobile battery efficiency

# Test Strategy:
Test audio system performs well during 60+ minute mobile sessions. Verify sanity-based audio effects enhance horror atmosphere. Validate audio streaming doesn't impact mobile performance.
