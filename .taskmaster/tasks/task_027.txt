# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement UI Corruption System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: System that makes the interface lie to the player based on sanity levels. Corrupts health bars, inventory descriptions, map layouts, and menu options to create supernatural horror effects.
# Details:
1. Create UICorruption autoload class for interface manipulation
2. Implement HealthBarCorruption for false health display
3. Create InventoryCorruption for item description lies
4. Implement MapCorruption for false room layouts
5. Add MenuCorruption for fake options and broken navigation
6. Create TextCorruption for randomized descriptions
7. Implement SaveUICorruption for fake save confirmations
8. Add corruption level system (None, Subtle, Obvious, Complete)
9. Ensure corruption doesn't break core touch functionality
10. Optimize corruption effects for mobile performance

# Test Strategy:
Verify UI corruption activates at correct sanity thresholds. Test that corruption effects feel supernatural but don't break gameplay. Validate mobile performance with active corruption.
