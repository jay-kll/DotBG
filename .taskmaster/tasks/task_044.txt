# Task ID: 44
# Title: Implement Safety and Quality Assurance System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 42, 43
# Priority: high
# Description: Comprehensive failsafe system preventing softlocks, ensuring progression validity, and maintaining narrative coherence. Includes debug logging like 'Why did this nightmare just spawn 4 priests inside a ladder?'
# Details:
1. Create SafetyChecker autoload for comprehensive validation
2. Implement softlock prevention and progression validation
3. Add mobile performance monitoring and limits
4. Create narrative coherence validation systems
5. Implement tag combination sensibility checking
6. Add generation logging and debug monitoring
7. Create quality metrics tracking and analytics
8. Implement safety system debugging and visualization
9. Add safety system documentation and guidelines
10. Optimize safety checking for mobile performance

# Test Strategy:
Test safety system prevents all softlocks and game-breaking combinations. Verify performance monitoring catches mobile issues. Validate debug logging provides useful information.
