# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Weapon Base Class Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a foundational weapon class that will serve as the parent for all weapon types in the game
### Details:
Implement a modular base class with essential properties and methods that all weapons will inherit. Include interfaces for damage calculation, animation triggers, sound effects, and state management. Ensure the architecture supports mobile-first development with optimized memory usage and performance considerations.

## 2. Implement Weapon Type System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive weapon type hierarchy with distinct categories and behaviors
### Details:
Create child classes for different weapon categories (melee, ranged, magical, etc.) that inherit from the base class. Define type-specific properties and behaviors while maintaining a consistent interface. Design the system to be extensible for future weapon types and ensure each type has unique characteristics that affect gameplay.

## 3. Develop Weapon Properties Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1
### Description: Build a flexible properties system for weapons with customizable attributes
### Details:
Implement a data-driven approach for weapon properties including damage, range, attack speed, weight, and special effects. Create a serializable property container that can be easily modified through the editor or at runtime. Optimize property calculations for mobile performance and ensure touch-friendly property visualization.

## 4. Create Attack Pattern System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Design and implement various attack patterns and combos for different weapon types
### Details:
Develop a flexible attack pattern system that supports different input methods (tap, hold, swipe) for mobile controls. Implement combo chains, charged attacks, and special moves with appropriate visual feedback. Create a testing framework to validate attack patterns across different device capabilities.

## 5. Implement Weapon Switching Mechanism [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2
### Description: Create a smooth and responsive weapon switching system with appropriate animations and state management
### Details:
Design a touch-friendly UI for weapon selection and quick-switching. Implement state transitions between weapons with appropriate animations and sound effects. Optimize the switching process to minimize performance impact on mobile devices and ensure proper cleanup of resources.

## 6. Develop Weapon Upgrade System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Create a progression system for weapons that allows for meaningful upgrades and improvements
### Details:
Implement a modular upgrade system that affects weapon properties and appearance. Design upgrade paths with clear visual and gameplay benefits. Create a data-driven approach to manage upgrade costs, requirements, and effects. Ensure the UI for upgrades is touch-friendly and provides clear feedback.

## 7. Implement Special Weapon Abilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.3
### Description: Design and implement unique abilities for weapons that provide tactical advantages
### Details:
Create a framework for special abilities that can be triggered through specific inputs or conditions. Implement cooldown management, resource costs, and visual effects for abilities. Ensure abilities are balanced and provide meaningful gameplay choices without overwhelming mobile device performance.

## 8. Create Visual and Sound Effects System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.4
### Description: Develop a comprehensive effects system for weapon interactions and feedback
### Details:
Implement particle systems, animation events, and sound triggers for weapon actions. Create a pooling system for effect objects to optimize performance on mobile devices. Design effects that scale appropriately based on device capabilities and provide clear feedback without overwhelming the player.

## 9. Implement Weapon Durability System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3
### Description: Create a durability mechanic that affects weapon performance and requires maintenance
### Details:
Design a durability system with visual indicators of weapon condition. Implement degradation logic based on usage patterns and environmental factors. Create repair mechanics and associated costs. Ensure the system adds strategic depth without frustrating players and provides appropriate mobile UI feedback.

## 10. Integrate Weapons with Inventory System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.2, 18.5
### Description: Connect the weapon system with the game's inventory management
### Details:
Implement inventory slots and weight considerations for weapons. Create interfaces for equipping, unequipping, and storing weapons. Design a touch-friendly UI for weapon management within the inventory. Optimize inventory operations to minimize performance impact on mobile devices.

## 11. Implement Weapon Scaling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 18.1, 18.3, 18.6
### Description: Create a system that scales weapon effectiveness based on player progression and game difficulty
### Details:
Design algorithms for weapon scaling based on player level, skills, or other progression metrics. Implement enemy scaling to maintain challenge throughout the game. Create a testing framework to validate weapon balance across different game stages. Ensure the scaling system is performant on mobile devices and provides appropriate feedback to players.
