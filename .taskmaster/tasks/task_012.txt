## 5. Design and Implement Preloading Strategies [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3
### Description: Develop preloading routines for critical assets and scenes to ensure seamless transitions and reduce perceived load times.
### Details:
Identify assets for preloading based on game flow. Implement prioritized preloading queues. Monitor memory usage during preloading.

## 6. Create Seamless Transition System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.2, 12.5
### Description: Build a transition manager to handle smooth scene and state changes, including fade-ins, animations, and asset handoffs.
### Details:
Support interruptible and queued transitions. Optimize for minimal frame drops on mobile. Integrate with touch input for user-driven transitions.

## 7. Implement Object Pooling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.1
### Description: Develop a pooling system for frequently used objects to reduce instantiation overhead and improve runtime performance.
### Details:
Support dynamic pool resizing and recycling. Profile memory and CPU usage. Ensure thread safety for pooled objects.

## 8. Integrate Multithreading and Concurrency [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.7
### Description: Enable concurrent loading, unloading, and pooling operations using threads or async patterns suitable for mobile platforms.
### Details:
Implement thread-safe queues and resource locks. Test for race conditions and deadlocks. Profile performance on target devices.

## 9. Establish Asset and Task Priority System [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.5, 12.8
### Description: Create a priority system for asset loading, preloading, and task execution to ensure critical resources are available when needed.
### Details:
Define priority levels and scheduling logic. Integrate with loading and pooling systems. Test with varying device memory and CPU constraints.

## 10. Optimize Memory Usage and Management [pending]
### Dependencies: 12.3, 12.7, 12.9
### Description: Implement memory tracking, leak detection, and optimization routines to minimize footprint and prevent crashes on low-memory devices.
### Details:
