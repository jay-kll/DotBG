# Task ID: 46
# Title: Implement Hybrid Mobile Optimization System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 42, 43, 44, 37
# Priority: high
# Description: Mobile-specific optimization for hybrid procedural generation. Includes generation time limits, memory management, and performance scaling for 50+ hour campaigns on mobile devices.
# Details:
1. Create MobileOptimizer for hybrid generation constraints
2. Implement generation time limits for mobile responsiveness
3. Add memory usage limits and management for hybrid content
4. Create performance scaling based on device capabilities
5. Implement hybrid content streaming and caching
6. Add mobile-specific quality settings and LOD systems
7. Create battery optimization for extended generation sessions
8. Implement thermal management for intensive generation
9. Add mobile performance debugging and profiling tools
10. Optimize all hybrid systems for mobile CPU/GPU constraints

# Test Strategy:
Test hybrid generation meets mobile performance requirements. Verify generation doesn't impact battery life significantly. Validate optimization scales across different mobile devices.
