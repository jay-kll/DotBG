# Task ID: 11
# Title: Create Room Content Placement System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9, 10
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the system for populating rooms with enemies, obstacles, traps, and interactive elements.
# Details:
1. Create ContentPlacer class
2. Implement enemy placement algorithms based on difficulty
3. Add obstacle and decoration placement
4. Create trap placement logic
5. Implement treasure and pickup placement
6. Add special object placement (shrines, altars, etc.)
7. Create content validation to ensure playability
8. Implement content balancing based on room position in dungeon
9. Add theme-specific content rules
10. Create content variation system for replayability

# Test Strategy:
Test content placement with various room configurations. Verify enemy placement creates balanced encounters. Test trap and obstacle placement for fairness. Verify content matches room themes correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Modular Placer Class Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define and implement a modular placer class structure that supports extensibility for different content types (enemies, obstacles, traps, treasures, special objects) and is optimized for mobile-first development.
### Details:
Ensure the placer class is decoupled from specific content logic, supports dependency injection, and can be easily extended for new object types. Prioritize touch-friendly interfaces and performance.

## 2. Implement Enemy Placement Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Develop algorithms for placing enemies in levels, balancing challenge and accessibility while considering mobile performance constraints.
### Details:
Use critical path analysis to avoid blocking player progression and ensure enemy placement is varied and fair. Integrate with the placer class and support touch-based debugging tools.

## 3. Implement Obstacle, Trap, and Treasure Placement [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Create logic for placing obstacles, traps, and treasures, ensuring they enhance gameplay variety and risk-reward dynamics.
### Details:
Ensure obstacles and traps do not block critical paths and treasures are placed in accessible but rewarding locations. Use theme rules to vary object types and appearances.

## 4. Integrate Special Object Placement [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1
### Description: Add support for placing special objects (e.g., keys, power-ups, quest items) with rules for rarity, accessibility, and gameplay impact.
### Details:
Ensure special objects are distributed according to theme and progression requirements, and that their placement is testable and adjustable.

## 5. Develop Placement Validation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Implement automated validation to ensure all placed content adheres to gameplay, accessibility, and theme rules.
### Details:
Check for blocked paths, unreachable treasures, overlapping objects, and compliance with theme-specific constraints. Provide touch-based feedback for quick iteration.

## 6. Balance Content Distribution [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.5
### Description: Analyze and adjust placement algorithms to balance difficulty, pacing, and player engagement across levels.
### Details:
Use data-driven methods and playtesting feedback to tune enemy density, obstacle frequency, and reward placement. Ensure performance remains optimal on mobile devices.

## 7. Implement Theme Rule System [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.1, 11.2, 11.3, 11.4
### Description: Create a flexible system for defining and applying theme-specific rules to content placement and appearance.
### Details:
Allow designers to specify rules for different themes (e.g., desert, cave, laboratory) affecting which objects appear and how they are rendered. Support easy theme switching and testing.

## 8. Develop Variation System for Placement [pending]
### Dependencies: 11.6, 11.7
### Description: Design and implement a system to introduce controlled variation in content placement to maximize replayability and uniqueness.
### Details:
Incorporate randomness, weighted choices, and rule-based modifiers to ensure each level feels distinct while maintaining balance and fairness.

## 9. Optimize for Mobile Performance and Touch Controls [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile and optimize all placement algorithms and systems for mobile devices, ensuring smooth performance and intuitive touch interactions.
### Details:
Minimize memory usage, reduce computational overhead, and ensure all debugging and editing tools are touch-friendly.

## 10. Modularize and Document Placement Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor and document all placement-related code to ensure modularity, maintainability, and ease of integration with other game systems.
### Details:
Produce clear API documentation, usage examples, and guidelines for extending or modifying the placement system for future content or themes.
