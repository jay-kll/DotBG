# Task ID: 5
# Title: Implement Player State Machine
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Create a comprehensive state machine to manage player states including idle, moving, attacking, dodging, and dead states.
# Details:
1. Create StateMachine class to manage state transitions
2. Implement base State class with enter/exit/update methods
3. Create specific state implementations:
   - IdleState
   - MovingState
   - AttackingState
   - DodgingState
   - DeadState
4. Add state transition logic and validation
5. Implement animation triggers for each state
6. Connect input handling to appropriate state changes
7. Add state debugging visualization
8. Create state persistence for save/load system
9. Optimize state updates for mobile performance

# Test Strategy:
Create test suite to verify all state transitions occur correctly. Test edge cases like interrupted states. Verify animations match states correctly. Profile performance of state machine updates.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Modular State Machine Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design a modular, extensible state machine architecture suitable for mobile-first development, ensuring clear separation of concerns and support for hierarchical or nested states.
### Details:
Establish base interfaces or abstract classes for states and the state machine. Ensure the architecture supports easy addition of new states and transitions, and is optimized for mobile performance.

## 2. Implement Base and Specific States [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create base state classes and implement specific states (e.g., Idle, Moving, Attacking) with encapsulated logic and data relevant to each state.
### Details:
Ensure each state handles its own entry, update, and exit logic. Use inheritance or composition to maximize code reuse and maintainability.

## 3. Develop Transition Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2
### Description: Define and implement clear, testable transition rules between states, including allowed transitions and conditions for each.
### Details:
Use a transition table or event-driven approach to manage state changes. Ensure transitions are atomic and prevent invalid state changes.

## 4. Integrate Animation Triggers [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Connect state changes to animation triggers, ensuring that entering or exiting a state reliably starts or stops the correct animations.
### Details:
Use a binding system or observer pattern to synchronize state changes with animation controllers. Optimize for minimal latency and smooth transitions.

## 5. Connect Input Handling (Touch Controls) [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Implement input handling tailored for mobile touch controls, mapping gestures and taps to state transitions and actions.
### Details:
Abstract input sources to allow for easy testing and future expansion. Ensure responsiveness and accuracy for common mobile gestures.

## 6. Implement Debugging Tools and State Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Develop debugging utilities to visualize current state, transitions, and input events in real time, aiding development and troubleshooting.
### Details:
Include logging, on-screen overlays, or integration with external tools to display state machine activity. Support step-through and replay of state transitions.

## 7. Add State Persistence and Restoration [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3
### Description: Enable saving and restoring the current state machine state, including all relevant data, to support app suspension, backgrounding, and resume.
### Details:
Implement serialization and deserialization of state and context. Ensure compatibility with mobile OS lifecycle events.

## 8. Optimize for Mobile Performance [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5
### Description: Profile and optimize the state machine for low memory usage, minimal CPU overhead, and fast state transitions on mobile devices.
### Details:
Identify bottlenecks, minimize allocations, and ensure efficient event processing. Test on a range of target devices for consistent performance.

## 9. Ensure Modular and Extensible Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 5.6, 5.7, 5.8
### Description: Review and refactor the codebase to maximize modularity, allowing for easy addition of new states, transitions, and input types without major rewrites.
### Details:
Document extension points, provide clear APIs, and write example modules to demonstrate extensibility. Validate with unit and integration tests.
