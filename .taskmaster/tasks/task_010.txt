# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Dungeon Layout System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the system for connecting rooms into a coherent dungeon layout with proper navigation.
# Details:
1. Create DungeonGenerator class
2. Implement room connection algorithms (hallways, doors)
3. Create dungeon layout patterns (linear, branching, loops)
4. Add difficulty progression through dungeon
5. Implement critical path generation
6. Create secret room placement logic
7. Add boss room placement at appropriate locations
8. Implement dungeon validation to ensure completability
9. Create minimap data generation
10. Optimize connection algorithms for mobile performance
11. Add dungeon theme application to rooms

# Test Strategy:
Test dungeon generation with various seeds. Verify all rooms are accessible. Test pathfinding through generated dungeons. Measure full dungeon generation time on target devices.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design Modular Generator Class Architecture [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define a modular, extensible generator class structure that supports mobile-first development and touch controls.
### Details:
Specify interfaces and abstract base classes for room, layout, and progression generation. Ensure clean separation of concerns and support for future extensions.

## 2. Implement Room Connection Algorithms [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop algorithms to connect rooms logically and efficiently, considering performance on mobile devices.
### Details:
Use efficient data structures (e.g., adjacency lists) and optimize for minimal memory usage. Ensure connections support both linear and branching layouts.

## 3. Develop Layout Pattern Modules [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Create reusable modules for different layout patterns (e.g., grid, branching, circular) with touch-friendly interaction.
### Details:
Implement pattern selection logic and ensure each pattern can be easily swapped or extended. Optimize for quick layout generation.

## 4. Establish Progression Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2, 10.3
### Description: Define and implement progression rules to guide player advancement through the generated layout.
### Details:
Ensure progression supports critical path identification and adapts to different layout patterns. Include logic for gating and unlocking rooms.

## 5. Critical Path Calculation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.4
### Description: Implement algorithms to identify and validate the critical path from start to goal, optimizing for performance.
### Details:
Use graph traversal (e.g., BFS/DFS) to determine the shortest or most appropriate critical path. Ensure results are consistent and testable.

## 6. Secret and Boss Room Placement Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.5
### Description: Develop logic for placing secret and boss rooms, ensuring they are accessible but not on the main critical path.
### Details:
Use probabilistic or rule-based placement, and validate that secret/boss rooms meet design constraints. Support touch-based discovery mechanics.

## 7. Validation and Consistency Checks [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create automated validation routines to ensure generated layouts are solvable, consistent, and meet design requirements.
### Details:
Check for unreachable rooms, cycles, and progression dead-ends. Provide detailed error reporting for debugging.

## 8. Minimap Generation and Touch Interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement a minimap system that visually represents the generated layout and supports touch-based navigation.
### Details:
Optimize minimap rendering for mobile devices. Ensure minimap updates dynamically as the player progresses.

## 9. Performance Optimization for Mobile [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Profile and optimize all generation and rendering routines for mobile performance and battery efficiency.
### Details:
Reduce memory allocations, minimize CPU usage, and batch rendering calls. Test on a range of mobile devices.

## 10. Theme Application and Modular Styling [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a system for applying visual themes to rooms and layouts, supporting modular and dynamic styling.
### Details:
Allow themes to be swapped at runtime and ensure all UI elements are touch-friendly and visually consistent.

## 11. Automated and Manual Testing Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Build comprehensive automated and manual test cases for all generator features, focusing on edge cases and mobile usability.
### Details:
Include unit, integration, and UI tests. Simulate touch interactions and validate performance under stress.

## 12. Documentation and Developer Guides [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Write detailed documentation and guides for the generator system, covering architecture, usage, and extension points.
### Details:
Ensure documentation is clear, up-to-date, and includes examples for mobile-first and modular development.
