# Task ID: 29
# Title: Implement Three-Act Structure System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 10, 11
# Priority: high
# Description: Core system managing the three distinct acts of the epic campaign: Act I (Descending City), Act II (Drowning Depths), Act III (Dream Realm). Each act has unique mechanics, rendering, and generation rules.
# Details:
1. Create ActManager autoload class for act progression
2. Implement Act1_TechnicalSpecs for city generation and urban rendering
3. Create Act2_TechnicalSpecs for water physics and organic rendering
4. Implement Act3_TechnicalSpecs for impossible geometry and reality distortion
5. Add act-specific rendering pipelines and shaders
6. Create act transition system with memory cleanup
7. Implement act-specific physics rules and generation algorithms
8. Add act-specific performance profiles for mobile optimization
9. Create act progression tracking and save integration
10. Document three-act technical architecture

# Test Strategy:
Test smooth transitions between acts without memory leaks. Verify each act's unique mechanics work correctly. Validate mobile performance across all three acts during extended play.
