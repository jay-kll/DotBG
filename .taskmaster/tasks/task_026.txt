# Task ID: 26
# Title: Implement Sanity Manager System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Core autoload system that controls reality distortion, UI corruption triggers, and save lies. This system tracks sanity levels (High 75-100%, Medium 50-74%, Low 25-49%, Zero 0-24%) and triggers appropriate corruption effects.
# Details:
1. Create SanityManager autoload class with sanity level tracking
2. Implement sanity change events via EventBus integration
3. Define sanity thresholds and their corresponding effects
4. Create sanity recovery and loss mechanisms
5. Integrate with UICorruption and SaveCorruption systems
6. Implement sanity persistence across save/load cycles
7. Add debug tools for testing sanity effects
8. Optimize for mobile performance during extended sessions
9. Create sanity visualization for development/testing
10. Document sanity system architecture and integration points

# Test Strategy:
Test sanity level changes trigger correct corruption effects. Verify sanity persistence across app lifecycle. Validate performance impact on mobile devices during 60+ minute sessions.
