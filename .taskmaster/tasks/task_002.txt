# Test Strategy:
Create test scene with visual feedback for touch inputs. Measure input latency across different Android devices. Verify multi-touch functionality works correctly. Test gesture recognition accuracy with various input patterns.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design InputManager Class Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define the modular architecture for the InputManager class, ensuring it supports extensibility for multi-touch, gestures, and platform abstraction.
### Details:
Specify interfaces, data flow, and event hooks. Plan for mobile-first and performance-oriented design.

## 2. Implement InputManager Core Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Develop the InputManager class to handle touch input collection, state management, and event dispatching.
### Details:
Support for primary and multiple touch points, event registration, and modular input sources.

## 3. Test InputManager Core Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Create unit and integration tests for InputManager, validating touch event collection, state transitions, and event propagation.
### Details:
Test on multiple mobile devices and emulators for consistency and correctness.

## 4. Implement Multi-Touch Support [done]
### Dependencies: 2.2
### Description: Add support for tracking multiple simultaneous touch points, including touch lifecycle (begin, move, end, cancel).
### Details:
Utilize platform APIs to track all active touches and expose them via InputManager.

## 5. Test Multi-Touch Handling [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop test cases for multi-touch scenarios, including edge cases like rapid touch changes and overlapping gestures.
### Details:
Verify correct touch tracking and event sequencing on various devices.

## 6. Implement Gesture Detection Module [done]
### Dependencies: 2.4
### Description: Develop a modular gesture detection system to recognize gestures such as tap, double-tap, swipe, pinch, and long press.
### Details:
Design for extensibility to add new gesture types easily.

## 7. Test and Optimize Gesture Detection [done]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Create automated and manual tests for gesture recognition accuracy and latency. Profile and optimize for low-latency detection.
### Details:
Test with real-world usage patterns and optimize for mobile performance.

## 8. Implement Event Propagation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.6
### Description: Develop a robust event propagation mechanism to deliver touch and gesture events to UI and game objects, supporting event bubbling and capture.
### Details:
Ensure modularity and allow for custom event listeners.

## 9. Implement Input Buffering and Debouncing [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Add input buffering and debouncing logic to handle rapid or noisy touch input, ensuring smooth and reliable gesture recognition.
### Details:
Optimize for minimal latency and resource usage.

## 10. Integrate Haptic Feedback Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Implement haptic feedback triggers for relevant gestures and touch events, with platform-specific optimizations.
### Details:
Allow configuration of feedback intensity and patterns.

## 11. Develop Sensitivity and Calibration Settings [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.6
### Description: Create user-configurable settings for touch sensitivity, gesture thresholds, and calibration routines.
### Details:
Expose settings via UI and persist user preferences.

## 12. Build Debugging and Performance Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.6, 2.8
### Description: Develop in-app debug overlays and logging tools to visualize touch points, gesture recognition, and event flow. Profile and optimize for low CPU/memory usage.
### Details:
Enable toggling of debug tools and export logs for analysis.
