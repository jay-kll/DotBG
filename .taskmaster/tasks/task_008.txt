# Task ID: 8
# Title: Implement Status Effect Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a flexible status effect system to handle bleeding, corruption, madness, and other temporary effects on entities.
# Details:
1. Create StatusEffect base class
2. Implement specific effect types:
   - BleedingEffect (damage over time)
   - CorruptionEffect (defense reduction)
   - MadnessEffect (random actions)
3. Add duration and stack mechanics for effects
4. Create visual indicators for active effects
5. Implement effect application and removal logic
6. Add resistance and immunity system
7. Create effect interaction rules (e.g., one cancels another)
8. Implement persistent effects for save/load
9. Add sound effects for status application
10. Create UI elements to show active status effects

# Test Strategy:
Test each status effect individually. Verify stacking and duration mechanics. Test interaction between different effects. Verify visual indicators appear correctly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Base Effect Class [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a modular, extensible base class for all effects, supporting mobile-first architecture and performance optimization.
### Details:
Define core properties (duration, source, target, etc.), lifecycle methods (apply, remove, update), and ensure compatibility with touch controls and modular systems.

## 2. Develop Effect Type System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement a flexible system for defining and registering multiple effect types (buffs, debuffs, DOT, HOT, etc.).
### Details:
Allow easy addition of new effect types via configuration or code, ensuring extensibility and performance for mobile devices.

## 3. Implement Effect Stacking Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Create rules and mechanisms for effect stacking, including stacking limits, refresh, and override behaviors.
### Details:
Support common stacking patterns (additive, exclusive, replace, refresh) and ensure efficient checks for mobile performance.

## 4. Integrate Visual Feedback for Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Design and implement visual indicators (icons, particle effects, overlays) for effect application and expiration, optimized for mobile screens.
### Details:
Ensure visuals are modular, lightweight, and responsive to touch interactions, with clear feedback for stacking and removal.

## 5. Handle Effect Application and Removal [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Develop robust logic for applying and removing effects, including event hooks and callbacks.
### Details:
Ensure atomicity, prevent race conditions, and support undo/redo for effect changes, with mobile performance in mind.

## 6. Implement Resistance and Immunity Systems [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.5
### Description: Create systems for entities to resist, reduce, or be immune to certain effect types, supporting extensible resistance rules.
### Details:
Allow for dynamic resistance values, stacking resistances, and clear feedback when effects are resisted or blocked.

## 7. Define Effect Interactions and Dependencies [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.2, 8.3, 8.6
### Description: Establish rules for how different effects interact (e.g., cleanse, amplify, suppress), supporting modular and extensible interactions.
### Details:
Implement a system for effect dependencies, triggers, and conditional logic, ensuring performance and clarity.

## 8. Ensure Effect Persistence and Serialization [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.5, 8.7
### Description: Implement persistence for active effects across sessions, including save/load and network sync for multiplayer.
### Details:
Optimize serialization for mobile storage and bandwidth, and ensure data integrity on effect restoration.

## 9. Integrate Sound Feedback for Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Add modular sound cues for effect application, stacking, expiration, and resistance, optimized for mobile audio constraints.
### Details:
Ensure sounds are non-intrusive, can be toggled, and are synchronized with visual feedback and touch events.

## 10. Design and Implement Effect UI Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.4, 8.6, 8.8
### Description: Create touch-friendly UI elements for displaying active effects, stacks, timers, and resistances.
### Details:
Ensure UI is modular, performant, and provides clear, actionable feedback for mobile users, supporting accessibility and customization.
