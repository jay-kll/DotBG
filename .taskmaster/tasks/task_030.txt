# Task ID: 30
# Title: Implement Mutation System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 26, 17
# Priority: medium
# Description: Permanent character evolution system allowing up to 3 mutations per run. Mutations provide both benefits and curses, affecting gameplay, visuals, and story routes through the epic campaign.
# Details:
1. Create MutationManager class for mutation tracking and application
2. Implement mutation data structure with benefits and drawbacks
3. Create visual mutation effects and character model changes
4. Add mutation acquisition system (Black Market, events, bosses)
5. Implement mutation synergy system for combined effects
6. Create mutation-specific dialogue and story branches
7. Add mutation persistence across the 50+ hour campaign
8. Implement mutation removal/replacement mechanics
9. Create mutation UI for tracking active mutations
10. Balance mutations for epic campaign progression

# Test Strategy:
Test mutation effects persist across save/load cycles. Verify mutation synergies work correctly. Validate mutation balance across 50+ hour campaigns.
