# Task ID: 6
# Title: Develop Dodge Rolling Mechanics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the dodge rolling mechanic with invincibility frames, animation, and touch button integration.
# Details:
1. Create DodgeRoll class to handle dodge mechanics
2. Implement dodge movement with proper physics
3. Add invincibility frames during dodge
4. Create dodge animation and effects
5. Connect dodge button to dodge action
6. Add dodge cooldown system
7. Implement dodge direction based on movement input
8. Create visual feedback for dodge cooldown
9. Add sound effects for dodge action
10. Implement dodge upgrades/modifications system for future expansion

# Test Strategy:
Test dodge functionality against enemies. Verify invincibility frames work correctly. Test dodge cooldown system. Measure performance impact of dodge effects.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Class Structure Design [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define modular, reusable class structures for core mechanics (player, enemy, abilities) with clear interfaces to minimize dependencies.
### Details:
Focus on separation of concerns and extensibility. Ensure classes are optimized for mobile performance and can be easily extended for upgrades or new features.

## 2. Movement System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a responsive movement system supporting touch controls and smooth transitions, optimized for mobile devices.
### Details:
Implement touch-based input handling for movement, ensuring low latency and high frame rates. Support for both analog and digital movement schemes.

## 3. Invincibility Mechanic Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Add invincibility logic with clear state transitions and visual feedback, ensuring minimal coupling with other systems.
### Details:
Implement invincibility as a state or component, with timers and hooks for triggering and ending invincibility. Ensure compatibility with animation and feedback systems.

## 4. Animation System Setup [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Integrate an efficient animation system that supports state-driven transitions and is optimized for mobile performance.
### Details:
Use sprite sheets or skeletal animation as appropriate. Ensure animations reflect movement, invincibility, and direction changes. Modularize for easy updates.

## 5. Touch Input Handling [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2
### Description: Implement robust touch input handlers for all core mechanics, ensuring responsiveness and intuitive controls.
### Details:
Support multi-touch gestures, swipes, and taps. Abstract input layer for easy adaptation to different devices or future input methods.

## 6. Cooldown System Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.5
### Description: Create a modular cooldown system for abilities and actions, with clear feedback and performance considerations.
### Details:
Ensure cooldowns are visually represented and do not block main thread. Allow for easy adjustment and upgrade hooks.

## 7. Direction and Orientation Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.2, 6.4
### Description: Implement direction tracking and orientation logic, ensuring seamless integration with movement and animation systems.
### Details:
Support 8-way or 360-degree direction as needed. Ensure direction changes are reflected in both visuals and gameplay logic.

## 8. Feedback and Visual Effects [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.7
### Description: Design and implement visual feedback for actions, state changes, and errors, optimized for mobile performance.
### Details:
Include particle effects, screen shakes, and UI cues. Modularize effects for easy reuse and extension.

## 9. Sound System Integration [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Integrate a lightweight, modular sound system for effects and feedback, with mobile performance in mind.
### Details:
Support for sound pooling, volume control, and event-driven playback. Ensure minimal latency and resource usage.

## 10. Upgrade and Extension Hooks [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.6, 6.8, 6.9
### Description: Implement hooks and extension points for upgrades, power-ups, and future feature additions.
### Details:
Design interfaces and event systems to allow new upgrades or mechanics to be added with minimal refactoring. Document extension points clearly.
